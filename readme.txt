Note: If downloading from Google Drive, please download the zip file contained within the CCM folder. Google Docs will automatically append file extensions to some unknown file types. For example, downloading the CCM folder, the file “ccm_template.mxd” will be appended with the extension “ccm_template.mxd.doc”, which will cause an error when running the program.

Quick installation and operation:
1) Unzip and place into the desired directory.
2) Open ArcMap.
3) Install and run the tool.
4) Load desired shapefile and specify parameters.
